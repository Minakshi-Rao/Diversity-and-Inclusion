# Background_Information

Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress. They’re reaching out to us for help.

At PwC Switzerland we are often approached by clients seeking support with diversity and inclusion. Companies need a workforce of diverse talents and backgrounds to succeed in an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. To us, diversity and inclusion are business imperatives, not just nice-to-haves. We aim for all of our teams to feel welcome and appreciated. But actually achieving this and unlocking its potential involves a whole set of practical challenges.

# Business Side

I have gained valuable insights into the realm of Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) metrics as they pertain to critical aspects of the corporate landscape, including recruitment, advancement, and workforce retention. This experience has allowed me to develop a comprehensive understanding of the significance of D&I analytics in shaping organizational strategies, fostering inclusivity, and achieving equitable talent management.

# Tech Side:

On the technical front, I have honed my skills in leveraging visual enhancements for data representation. Specifically, I have acquired proficiency in creating gradient overlays within Microsoft PowerPoint and employing this technique to elevate the visual appeal and clarity of area charts when working with Power BI. This capability not only enhances the aesthetics of data presentation but also contributes to more effective data communication and decision-making processes within the realm of business intelligence.
